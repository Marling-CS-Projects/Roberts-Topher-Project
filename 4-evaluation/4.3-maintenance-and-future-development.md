# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of the Project

* Platform availability - can only be played on the browser on a pc
* Time to complete - With only 5 levels the game can be over within 1-2 mins
* Art -No consistent style and there is a spread of sources when it comes to assets&#x20;

## Maintenance

* Game expansion requires a short-term development phase to eliminate bugs and prepare for ongoing growth.
* The long-term development plan will introduce new features, expanding the project's codebase.
* To manage this growth, the current limitations of the project must be assessed and modified to guide the game's expansion.
* As the project grows, it will become too large for a single developer to handle, necessitating a team of approximately 2 to 3 people.
* This is important as the game's growth may attract a larger player base, leading to increased demands for ongoing development.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

* Flesh out the win and loss scenes
* Fix the pause menu and system
* Add more to the wall jump mechanic as in its current state it is very difficult to execute
* ensure the glitch with the star power-up isn't repeatable

### Long-Term Addressing Limitations

* Custom Control schemes
  * Allow players to customize their control inputs
  * Let them remap buttons to their liking, providing a more comfortable gaming experience.
* Higher level count
  * Adding more levels would increase the amount of time the game takes to play through and allow for more gameplay variety, this would attract more players and increase demand for the game
* Increase enemy and boss variation
  * The same applies to enemy and boss variation, thus increasing demand
* add a wider range of power-ups
  * Allows for ways to play the game hence increasing variation and replayability&#x20;
* Leader board system&#x20;
  * Times are scored and compared against each other, adding a multiplayer aspect

With these new features, the Limitations will change

* Higher minimum spec
* Limited to 2D
* multiplayer wouldn't be cross-platform
