### Criterion 1

Evidence for success/failure



Description of success

For basic movement controls I implemented movement for let and right using the respective arrow keys, as well as the space bar for jumping/ moving vertically. Use of the other arrow keys was deemed unnecessary. However with more time/ sufficient request from testing i could have implemented other key binds for accessibility reason, such as using up arrow to jump as well or even custom key binds accessible though the menu.&#x20;

### Criterion 2

Evidence for success/failure



Description of success

For Power ups I have several ideas in mind but the difficult in executing them lead me to narrow it down to just two, however due to a bug in my game allowing player to stick to walls for a short period of time and reset there jumps this inveterately added a 3rd power up this being he double jump, thus I decided to add this as a feature, although the wall jump is very difficult to execute in its current state if I were to spend more time developing this i would add a tutorial as well as decrease the size of the floor tiles to make the double jump easier to preform. For the other indented power ups there are also bugs, which although they are repeatable, are not game breaking. To go into more detail and provide an example, the biggity power up would cause the player to fall through the floor in some cases hover this is avoidable if the power up is places in the air instead of the floor. And finally the double jump feature works as intended.



### Criterion 3



Description of success

The original idea for my games enemies was to have several bosses all taking advantage of a player using a certain power up to be able to defeat them. however as time progress i realised this level of complexity was not only unnecessary for acceding a top grade but was well out of my skill level, thus I decide on implementing an Ai for the final boss that would constantly work out the position of the player and chase them in order to make contact with them and playing a loss scene. When originally implementing this concept the boss just moved left and write following the player as the game is in 2D making it seem virality identical to a regular enemy by the time the player interacted with the boss. This was discovered during testing and the way i found the right values was during testing, afte this process the Ai was much more apperant and noticlble by the players

### Criterion 4



Description of success

For enemy design I had many more ideas for implementation but I decided to keep it more simple, using them as a key obstacle to increase the difficulty of the level the reason for this is due to time and efficiency making enemies more complex wouldn't generate any more marks. The enemies were also a key part in making the game more engaging and is where the majority of the difficulty was added as they were the most common enemy. as this was the case it made the adjusting of difficult much easier as I could change the speed and size individually to fit each level, this would be a lot more difficult if all the enemies were different with there own traits.&#x20;



### Criterion 5



Orignialy i planned on implementing check points however, i felt that they make the game too easy. and with only a small amount of levels was untimalty deemed unecicary.&#x20;





### Criterion 6



Varying Level design, This is a key element in making an engaging game, without implementing this the game become stale, this is also helpful for adding different game mechanics as you can make levels tailored for them to best display and utilize such mechanics for example a level with large vertical wall to encourage players to use the wall climb mechanic&#x20;



### Criterion 7

Scoreing system works by the player earning points from geting powerups aswell as defeating enemys, the final score is displayed at the end of the once completed, i orignialy thought of adding a timer that would add mulitplier to the score but in the end was deemned unecicary.



### Criterion 8

I added a pause menu allowing playes to pause the game and unpause whenever they disire. Orignialy i had planned a starting menu&#x20;



### Criterion 9



An appropite age rating was achived throught the game by using a catoony art stlye and the lack of any graphic content, the reason for this is to ensure the game can be enjoyed by all audinces to maxamise the player base. since the game is also fairly easy it, the gameplay caters itself to a younger audience with simple controls and a clear and easy objective. &#x20;
