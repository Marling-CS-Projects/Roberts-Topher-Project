### Criterion 1

Evidence for success/failure



Description of success

For basic movement controls i implemented movement for let and right using the respective arrow keys, aswell as the space bar for jumping/ moving vertically. Use of the other arrow keys was deemed unnecessary. However with more time/ sufficient request from testing i could have implemented other key binds for accessibility reason, such as using up arrow to jump as well or even custom key binds accessible though the menu.&#x20;
