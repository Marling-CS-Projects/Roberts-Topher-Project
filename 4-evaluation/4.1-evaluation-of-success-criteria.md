### Criterion 1

Evidence for success/failure



Description of success

For basic movement controls I implemented movement for let and right using the respective arrow keys, as well as the space bar for jumping/ moving vertically. Use of the other arrow keys was deemed unnecessary. However with more time/ sufficient request from testing i could have implemented other key binds for accessibility reason, such as using up arrow to jump as well or even custom key binds accessible though the menu.&#x20;

### Criterion 2

Evidence for success/failure



Description of success

For Power ups I have several ideas in mind but the difficult in executing them lead me to narrow it down to just two, however due to a bug in my game allowing player to stick to walls for a short period of time and reset there jumps this inveterately added a 3rd power up this being he double jump, thus I decided to add this as a feature, although the wall jump is very difficult to execute in its current state if I were to spend more time developing this i would add a tutorial as well as decrease the size of the floor tiles to make the double jump easier to preform. For the other indented power ups there are also bugs, which although they are repeatable, are not game breaking. To go into more detail and provide an example, the biggity power up would cause the player to fall through the floor in some cases hover this is avoidable if the power up is places in the air instead of the floor. And finally the double jump feature works as intended.



### Criterion 3



Description of success

The original idea for my games enemies was to have several bosses all taking advantage of a player using a certain power up to be able to defeat them. however as time progress i realised this level of complexity was not only unnecessary for acceding a top grade but was well out of my skill level, thus I decide on implementing an Ai for the final boss that would constantly work out the position of the player and chase them in order to make contact with them and playing a loss scene. When originally implementing this concept the boss just moved left and write following the player as the game is in 2D making it seem virality identical to a regular enemy by the time the player interacted with the boss. There fore I came to the idea that the boss should be airborne and fly into the player, this made the game much more difficult with is something I had been struggling with during the development process and became much more apparent once the game was tested by my peers.

### Criterion 4



Description of success

For enemy design I had many more ideas for implementation but I decided to keep it more simple, using them as a key obstacle to increase the difficulty of the level the reason for this is due to time and efficiency making enemies more complex wouldn't generate any more marks. The enemies were also a key part in making the game more engaging and is where the majority of the difficulty was added as they were the most common enemy. as this was the case it made the adjusting of difficult much easier as I could change the speed and size individually to fit each level, this would be a lot more difficult if all the enemies were different with there own traits.&#x20;
