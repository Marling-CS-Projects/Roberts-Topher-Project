## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

The game mechanics, level design, character abilities and controls, aesthetic and audio design, and target demographic are all crucial details for creating a 2D platformer. Information on the development platform's capabilities and restrictions, such as details on the languages, engines, and software tools used, would also be essential.

The calculations required to create a 2D platformer would rely on the game's particular specifications. A few of the calculations that could be necessary are as follows:

## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
