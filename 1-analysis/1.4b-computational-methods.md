## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

The game mechanics, level design, character abilities and controls, aesthetic and audio design, and target demographic are all crucial details for creating a 2D platformer. Information on the development platform's capabilities and restrictions, such as details on the languages, engines, and software tools used, would also be essential.

The calculations required to create a 2D platformer would rely on the game's particular specifications. A few of the calculations that could be necessary are as follows:

* Physics simulations for character movement, gravity, collisions, and object interactions.&#x20;
* Pathfinding algorithms for character movement and enemy AI.
* Procedural generation algorithms for creating randomized levels, enemies, and power-ups. -
* Game logic and scripting for implementing mechanics, scoring, and level progression.&#x20;
* Asset creation and optimization for graphics, audio, and animations.&#x20;

To be sure that the problem of developing a 2D platformer has been solved, the game should be thoroughly tested and evaluated. This would involve checking for bugs, glitches, and errors, as well as testing the game's mechanics, level design, and difficulty. Player feedback and reviews could also be used to gauge the success of the game. Additionally, metrics such as game completion rate, playtime, and score could be used to evaluate the game's performance
