## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

The game mechanics, level design, character abilities and controls, aesthetic and audio design, and target demographic are all crucial details for creating a 2D platformer. Information on the development platform's capabilities and restrictions, such as details on the languages, engines, and software tools used, would also be essential.

The calculations required to create a 2D platformer would rely on the game's particular specifications. A few of the calculations that could be necessary are as follows:

* Physics simulations for character movement, gravity, collisions, and object interactions.&#x20;
* Pathfinding algorithms for character movement and enemy AI.
* Procedural generation algorithms for creating randomized levels, enemies, and power-ups. -
* Game logic and scripting for implementing mechanics, scoring, and level progression.&#x20;
* Asset creation and optimization for graphics, audio, and animations.&#x20;

To be sure that the problem of developing a 2D platformer has been solved, the game should be thoroughly tested and evaluated. This would involve checking for bugs, glitches, and errors, as well as testing the game's mechanics, level design, and difficulty. Player feedback and reviews could also be used to gauge the success of the game. Additionally, metrics such as game completion rate, playtime, and score could be used to evaluate the game's performance

## Thinking Ahead

1. Define the Game Mechanics: Determine the core mechanics and features of your platformer. Think about how the player will interact with the game, such as jumping, running, or collecting items. Consider any unique elements or power-ups you want to incorporate.
2. Design the Level Structure: Plan the layout of your game levels. Decide on the size, complexity, and overall design of each level. Consider the placement of platforms, obstacles, enemies, and any other interactive elements. This will help you create a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
3. Create Art Assets: Depending on your skills and resources, decide whether you will create your own game art or use pre-made assets. If you choose to create your own, sketch out the visual style and design of your game, including the avatar, platforms, backgrounds, and any other graphical elements.
4. Implement Player Movement: Begin coding the movement mechanics for your playable avatar. This includes handling basic actions like walking, jumping, and crouching. Test and refine the movement until it feels smooth and responsive. Consider incorporating animations to bring your avatar to life.
5. Build the First Level: Start building the first level of your platformer. Use the level structure you designed earlier and implement the platforms, obstacles, and interactive elements. Ensure that the player can navigate the level, reach the goal, and encounter any challenges or puzzles you have planned.
6. Iterate and Refine: Test your game frequently, playtesting each level and mechanic as you go. Identify any issues, bugs, or areas that need improvement and make the necessary adjustments. Continuously iterate and refine your game to ensure it provides an enjoyable and polished experience.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is indeed an essential aspect of software development, including the development of a 2D platformer. It involves breaking down a larger problem or task into smaller, more manageable sub-processes or routines. This approach allows you to tackle each sub-task individually and ensure that the overall project progresses smoothly. Here's how decomposition can be applied to the development of a 2D platformer:

Begin by identifying the main components and functionalities your platformer will require. This could include player movement, level design, enemy behaviour, collision detection, scoring system, and user interface. Take each main component and further break it down into smaller sub-tasks. For example, the player movement component could involve tasks such as handling input controls, updating the player's position, implementing physics-based movement, and handling animations.

Once you have identified the sub-tasks for each component, determine the most logical order in which to work on them. Consider any dependencies between tasks and prioritize those that are foundational to other aspects of the game. This ensures that you establish a solid foundation before moving on to more complex features.

By concentrating on one sub-task at a time, you can maintain a clear focus and prevent becoming overwhelmed with multiple tasks. For instance, you can start by implementing the basic player movement, ensuring it functions correctly before moving on to more advanced actions like jumping or crouching. As you complete each sub-task, it's crucial to thoroughly test it in isolation. By doing so, you can identify any issues or bugs and refine the implementation until it meets your desired outcome. This iterative process helps ensure the quality and reliability of each individual component.

After completing and testing multiple sub-tasks, it's time to integrate them into the larger project. Gradually bring together different components, verifying that they work harmoniously together. This step-by-step integration approach helps detect and resolve conflicts or inconsistencies early on. Once you have integrated the sub-tasks, it's important to playtest the game as a whole. Pay attention to the overall gameplay experience, identifying areas that require improvement. Iterate on your design by tweaking mechanics, adjusting level difficulty, and enhancing visuals or audio elements. This iterative process allows you to refine and enhance the game based on user feedback and your own observations.

By following this decomposition-based approach, you can systematically develop your 2D platformer, ensuring that each sub-task is completed and thoroughly tested before moving on. This structured methodology helps maintain clarity, manage complexity, and ultimately leads to a well-designed and enjoyable game.

## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically is indeed valuable in various aspects of life, including game development. Applying logical thinking ensures that your game is well-designed, playable, and provides a satisfying experience for the user. Here's how you can apply logical thinking to the development of a 2D platformer:

1. Player Control and Interaction:
   1. Determine how the player will control the character. Decide on the movement controls, such as using arrow keys or WASD for directional movement.&#x20;
   2. Implement the logic for player input, allowing the character to respond accordingly. For example, when the player presses the jump key, the character should perform a jump action.&#x20;
   3. Consider how the character interacts with the environment, such as pushing objects, collecting items, or triggering switches. Define the logic behind these interactions.&#x20;
2. Enemy Behavior:
   1. Design the behaviour of enemies. Determine their patrol paths, movement patterns, and reactions to the player's presence.&#x20;
   2. Implement logic to detect when the player comes within the enemy's detection range. This could involve checking collision detection or using sight cones to determine the line of sight.&#x20;
   3. Decide how enemies will respond to the player's presence. They may start chasing the player, attacking, or triggering other actions based on the game's mechanics.&#x20;
3. Camera Movement:
   1. Plan how the camera will follow the player. Consider different camera styles, such as fixed, smooth scrolling, or dynamic tracking based on player movement.&#x20;
   2. Implement the logic for the camera to smoothly follow the player's position, adjusting as the player moves through the game world.&#x20;
   3. Ensure that the camera movement is logical and intuitive, providing the player with a clear view of the game environment and maintaining focus on the character.&#x20;
4. Saving Progress:
   1. Decide when and how to save the player's progress. Determine if progress should be saved automatically at specific checkpoints or manually triggered by the player.&#x20;
   2. Implement the logic to store and retrieve player progress, including variables like completed levels, unlocked items, and high scores.&#x20;
   3. Ensure that the saved progress is maintained between gameplay sessions but not during levels, following the classic game structure you mentioned.&#x20;
   4. Throughout the development process, regularly test and debug your game to ensure that the logic is functioning as intended.&#x20;
   5. Iterate on the design and logic based on user feedback and playtesting to improve the overall experience.&#x20;
   6. Logical thinking will help you tackle challenges, break them down into manageable steps, and create a more coherent and enjoyable 2D platformer for players to engage with.
