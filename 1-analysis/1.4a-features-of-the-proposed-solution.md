# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Controls

I want to keep controls simple as conventional using W/A/S/D for movement in cardinal directions Space. This helps new players. However, I will implement a key bind feature allowing users to edit their controls to suit them. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfB0u9g2x0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfB0u9g2x0)

### Movement

In a 2D side-scrolling platforming game, movement is an essential gameplay mechanic that can make or break the player's experience. Precise and fluid movement is key to success in these types of games, as players must navigate through various obstacles and challenges using a combination of jumping, running, and other movement mechanics.

The level design of a side-scrolling platformer is often complex and requires players to execute specific movements with accuracy and timing to progress. Failure to execute movements with precision can result in the player falling off the edge or colliding with obstacles, leading to frustration and repetitive gameplay. On the other hand, when players are able to move with ease and responsiveness, they can feel a sense of accomplishment and mastery over the game's mechanics.

Animation is a key component of movement in side-scrolling platformers, as it can help convey the weight, momentum, and physicality of the player character. By using animation to convey movement, players can feel more immersed in the game world and have a better sense of control over their characters.

In addition, movement in side-scrolling platformers is closely tied to the overall enjoyment of the game. The ability to execute acrobatic feats, navigate challenging terrain, and defeat enemies using movement mechanics is what makes these types of games so fun and engaging. Smooth and responsive movement can make players feel like they have a high level of control over their character and the game world, enhancing the immersive and enjoyable experience of playing.

### Power-Ups&#x20;

Power-ups are an integral aspect of 2D side-scrolling platforming games, adding variety and new gameplay mechanics to the mix. Unique power-ups can help players overcome obstacles and reach new areas of the game world.

The double jump power-up is a classic example of a power-up in platforming games, enabling players to jump a second time in mid-air. This power-up can help players reach higher platforms, dodge obstacles, and access hidden areas that would otherwise be out of reach. The double jump power-up also adds a new level of mobility to the game, allowing players to move more fluidly and creatively through the game world.

Wall climb is another popular power-up in platforming games, allowing players to climb up walls and other vertical surfaces. This power-up can be used to access new areas of the game world, avoid enemies, and reach higher platforms. The wall climb power-up also adds a new level of strategy to the game, as players must carefully plan their movements and use their environment to their advantage.

The time freeze would enable players to temporarily freeze time, allowing them to navigate through complex obstacles or defeat enemies without being hindered by their movements. This power-up could also be used to solve puzzles or access hidden areas of the game world that would be impossible to reach without the added benefit of stopping time.

### Save States

A well-designed save system is a crucial component of any 2D side-scrolling platforming game, ensuring that players can progress through the game at their own pace without the risk of losing their progress. A save system that is too sparse or too punishing can lead to frustration and cause players to lose interest in the game, while a save system that is too lenient can remove the sense of challenge and achievement that comes with overcoming difficult obstacles.



## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
