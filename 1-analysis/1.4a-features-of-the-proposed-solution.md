# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Controls

I want to keep controls simple as conventional using W/A/S/D for movement in cardinal directions Space. This helps new players. However, I will implement a key bind feature allowing users to edit their controls to suit them. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfB0u9g2x0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfB0u9g2x0)

### Movement

In a 2D side-scrolling platforming game, movement is an essential gameplay mechanic that can make or break the player's experience. Precise and fluid movement is key to success in these types of games, as players must navigate through various obstacles and challenges using a combination of jumping, running, and other movement mechanics.

The level design of a side-scrolling platformer is often complex and requires players to execute specific movements with accuracy and timing to progress. Failure to execute movements with precision can result in the player falling off the edge or colliding with obstacles, leading to frustration and repetitive gameplay. On the other hand, when players are able to move with ease and responsiveness, they can feel a sense of accomplishment and mastery over the game's mechanics.

Animation is a key component of movement in side-scrolling platformers, as it can help convey the weight, momentum, and physicality of the player character. By using animation to convey movement, players can feel more immersed in the game world and have a better sense of control over their character.



## Limitations
