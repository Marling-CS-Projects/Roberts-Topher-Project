### Conrtrols

I would like to keep controls simple as convetional yousinf W/A/S/D for movment in cardinal directions Space. This helps new players. Howerver i will implement a keybind feature allowing users to edit their controls too suit them.

It is intrgral that movemnt within the game is as easy as possible as smooth, as precice movment is key in platfroming games. This also makes the game more fun&#x20;

## Limitations
