### Movement

In a 2D side-scrolling platforming game, movement is an essential gameplay mechanic that can make or break the player's experience. Precise and fluid movement is key to success in these types of games, as players must navigate through various obstacles and challenges using a combination of jumping, running, and other movement mechanics.

The level design of a side-scrolling platformer is often complex and requires players to execute specific movements with accuracy and timing to progress. Failure to execute movements with precision can result in the player falling off the edge or colliding with obstacles, leading to frustration and repetitive gameplay. On the other hand, when players are able to move with ease and responsiveness, they can feel a sense of accomplishment and mastery over the game's mechanics.

Animation is a key component of movement in side-scrolling platformers, as it can help convey the weight, momentum, and physicality of the player character. By using animation to convey movement, players can feel more immersed in the game world and have a better sense of control over their characters.

In addition, movement in side-scrolling platformers is closely tied to the overall enjoyment of the game. The ability to execute acrobatic feats, navigate challenging terrain, and defeat enemies using movement mechanics is what makes these types of games so fun and engaging. Smooth and responsive movement can make players feel like they have a high level of control over their character and the game world, enhancing the immersive and enjoyable experience of playing.

### Power-Ups&#x20;

Power-ups are an integral aspect of 2D side-scrolling platforming games, adding variety and new gameplay mechanics to the mix. Unique power-ups can help players overcome obstacles and reach new areas of the game world.

The double jump power-up is a classic example of a power-up in platforming games, enabling players to jump a second time in mid-air. This power-up can help players reach higher platforms, dodge obstacles, and access hidden areas that would otherwise be out of reach. The double jump power-up also adds a new level of mobility to the game, allowing players to move more fluidly and creatively through the game world.

Wall climb is another popular power-up in platforming games, allowing players to climb up walls and other vertical surfaces. This power-up can be used to access new areas of the game world, avoid enemies, and reach higher platforms. The wall climb power-up also adds a new level of strategy to the game, as players must carefully plan their movements and use their environment to their advantage.

The time freeze would enable players to temporarily freeze time, allowing them to navigate through complex obstacles or defeat enemies without being hindered by their movements. This power-up could also be used to solve puzzles or access hidden areas of the game world that would be impossible to reach without the added benefit of stopping time.

### Menu

There are several key factors that are integral in making a menu as it allows players to navigate and access different game modes and options

* Design: The design of the menu should be consistent with the overall theme and aesthetic of the game. For example, if the game has a retro theme, the menu should incorporate a similar design style. Using fonts, colours, and other design elements that are consistent with the game's overall visual style can create a cohesive and immersive experience for players.
* Navigation: Navigation should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear options and buttons for players to select. Organizing the menu into different sections, such as "Play", "Options", and "Quit", can make it easier for players to find what they're looking for.
* Options: Providing different options for players, such as adjusting sound levels or changing control settings, can improve the overall accessibility of the game. Including a tutorial or a help section can also make it easier for new players to understand the game mechanics.
* Progression tracking: The menu can also be used to track the player's progression throughout the game. For example, including a "High Score" section or a "Level Select" option can provide players with a sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep playing.

### Save States

A well-designed save system is a crucial component of any 2D side-scrolling platforming game, ensuring that players can progress through the game at their own pace without the risk of losing their progress. A save system that is too sparse or too punishing can lead to frustration and cause players to lose interest in the game, while a save system that is too lenient can remove the sense of challenge and achievement that comes with overcoming difficult obstacles.

One approach to a save system in a platforming game is to use checkpoints. Checkpoints are designated areas in the game world where players can save their progress, and they are typically placed at strategic points in the game, such as after difficult obstacles or before boss battles. Checkpoints give players a sense of accomplishment and provide a clear indication of their progress through the game.

### Level design

In a 2D side-scrolling platforming game, the level design is paramount to the success of the game. The incorporation of power-ups is a popular feature in these types of games and can greatly enhance the gameplay experience. Specifically, power-ups such as wall climbing, double jumping, and time freezing can add new dimensions to the player's movement abilities and present unique design challenges for level designers.

Wall climbing, for example, allows players to traverse vertical surfaces, opening up new possibilities for level design. Levels could incorporate vertical paths or areas that can only be accessed by wall climbing, providing new challenges for the player. However, it's important for level designers to balance the use of wall climbing with other movement abilities to ensure that it doesn't become the only way to progress through the game.

Double jumping, on the other hand, can be used to extend the distance and height of a player's jump. This power-up can be used to create longer gaps between platforms or to reach higher areas. However, level designers must be careful not to make the levels too dependent on double jumping, as it can make the game too easy or unbalanced.

Time freezing is another interesting power-up that can be incorporated into level design. This ability allows players to freeze time, giving them a brief moment to assess their surroundings and plan their next move. Level designers can use this power-up to create puzzles or obstacles that require careful planning and precise timing to navigate.

### Enemy design

Enemies are a crucial aspect of 2D side-scrolling platforming games, and they can make or break the player's experience. The implementation of pathfinding enemies is an effective way to challenge the player and make the game more dynamic. Here are some examples of the types of enemies that can be implemented in a 2D side-scrolling platforming game:

* Basic enemies: Basic enemies are usually the most common type of enemy in platforming games. They are relatively easy to defeat and often serve as an introduction to the game's combat mechanics. Basic enemies can be designed in many different ways, such as simple ground-based creatures or flying enemies that require the player to jump and dodge to avoid.
* Environmental enemies: Environmental enemies are enemies that are integrated into the game's level design. Examples of environmental enemies include falling boulders or collapsing platforms that the player must avoid. These types of enemies add an extra layer of challenge to the game and can create a more immersive experience for the player.
* Bosses: Bosses are powerful enemies that are designed to challenge the player and often require unique strategies to defeat. Bosses can be designed to have multiple stages, each with their own unique attacks and patterns. Designing bosses that require the player to use all their acquired abilities and experience can create an intense and rewarding experience for players.

And for a more complex challenge plan to implement enemies that can follow the player and adapt to their movements, making for dynamic and unpredictable gameplay. When implementing pathfinding enemies, it's important to balance the challenge with fairness. For example, enemies that are too aggressive or overpowered can make the game frustrating and unfun, while enemies that are too easy to avoid can make the game too easy. Designing enemies that require careful planning and skilful manoeuvring to defeat can make for engaging and satisfying gameplay.
