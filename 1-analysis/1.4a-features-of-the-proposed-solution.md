## Mechanics

### Controls

I want to keep controls simple as conventional using W/A/S/D for movement in cardinal directions Space. This helps new players. However, I will implement a key bind feature allowing users to edit their controls to suit them. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfB0u9g2x0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfB0u9g2x0)

### Movement

Movement is a critical gameplay aspect for 2D side scrolling platform games as it can substantially impact player experiences. Game success is closely linked to how seamless and precise players move since they must overcome various obstacles with jumping, running and other movement mechanics in order to progress. Complex game level designs require players to execute specific movements accurately which can be challenging leading to falls from edges or hitting obstacles; this repetition may result in frustration. Movement ease and response sensitivity are highly coveted gaming features that confer a sense of mastery over game mechanics when achieved by players. Animation takes center stage during such moves since it helps illustrate character weight/momentum/physicality accurately increasing user immersion while improving their control over character actions. The thrill of playing side scrolling platformers ultimately rests on mastering the movement mechanics involved. Players derive immense satisfaction from navigating treacherous landscapes executing impressive acrobatics and defeating adversaries with their agility and dexterity. Smooth and responsive movement can make players feel like they have a high level of control over their character and the game world, enhancing the immersive and enjoyable experience of playing.

### Power-Ups&#x20;

Power-ups are special items in video games that give players new abilities to help them overcome challenges and explore more of the game world. For example, a double jump power-up lets players jump twice in mid-air to reach higher places and avoid obstacles. Another power-up lets players climb up walls to reach new areas and avoid enemies. And a time freeze power-up lets players temporarily stop time to get past difficult obstacles or solve puzzles. These power-ups add more excitement and strategy to the game.

### Menu

The creation of a menu is a crucial aspect in facilitating player interaction with various game modes and features, as it involves the implementation of several essential components.

* The menu design should align with the game's overarching theme and aesthetic. If the game exudes a vintage vibe, the menu should reflect the same design style. Employing font types, color schemes, and other design elements that harmonize with the game's visual style can foster a unified and captivating experience for players.
* In order to create a user-friendly experience, it is important to design the navigation system in a way that is intuitive and easy to use. This can be achieved by providing clear options and buttons for players to select. One effective strategy is to organize the menu into different sections, such as "Play", "Options", and "Quit", which can help players quickly locate the desired feature. By implementing these principles, players are more likely to enjoy the game and have a positive experience.
* To enhance the accessibility of a game, it is important to offer a variety of options for players. This can include the ability to adjust sound levels or change control settings to suit individual preferences. Additionally, incorporating a tutorial or help section can aid new players in understanding the game mechanics more easily. By providing a range of customizable features and informative resources, players of all skill levels can more fully enjoy the game.
* In addition to its primary purpose, the game's menu can serve as a means of monitoring the player's advancement within the game. One way this can be achieved is through the inclusion of a "High Score" category or a "Level Select" feature, both of which can instill a sense of achievement in players and inspire them to continue playing.

### Save States

A well-designed save system is a crucial component of any 2D side-scrolling platforming game, ensuring that players can progress through the game at their own pace without the risk of losing their progress. A save system that is too sparse or too punishing can lead to frustration and cause players to lose interest in the game, while a save system that is too lenient can remove the sense of challenge and achievement that comes with overcoming difficult obstacles.

One approach to a save system in a platforming game is to use checkpoints. Checkpoints are designated areas in the game world where players can save their progress, and they are typically placed at strategic points in the game, such as after difficult obstacles or before boss battles. Checkpoints give players a sense of accomplishment and provide a clear indication of their progress through the game.

### Level design

In a 2D side-scrolling platforming game, the level design is paramount to the success of the game. The incorporation of power-ups is a popular feature in these types of games and can greatly enhance the gameplay experience. Specifically, power-ups such as wall climbing, double jumping, and time freezing can add new dimensions to the player's movement abilities and present unique design challenges for level designers.

Wall climbing, for example, allows players to traverse vertical surfaces, opening up new possibilities for level design. Levels could incorporate vertical paths or areas that can only be accessed by wall climbing, providing new challenges for the player. However, it's important for level designers to balance the use of wall climbing with other movement abilities to ensure that it doesn't become the only way to progress through the game.

Double jumping, on the other hand, can be used to extend the distance and height of a player's jump. This power-up can be used to create longer gaps between platforms or to reach higher areas. However, level designers must be careful not to make the levels too dependent on double jumping, as it can make the game too easy or unbalanced.

Time freezing is another interesting power-up that can be incorporated into level design. This ability allows players to freeze time, giving them a brief moment to assess their surroundings and plan their next move. Level designers can use this power-up to create puzzles or obstacles that require careful planning and precise timing to navigate.

### Enemy design

Enemies are a crucial aspect of 2D side-scrolling platforming games, and they can make or break the player's experience. The implementation of pathfinding enemies is an effective way to challenge the player and make the game more dynamic. Here are some examples of the types of enemies that can be implemented in a 2D side-scrolling platforming game:

* Basic enemies: Basic enemies are usually the most common type of enemy in platforming games. They are relatively easy to defeat and often serve as an introduction to the game's combat mechanics. Basic enemies can be designed in many different ways, such as simple ground-based creatures or flying enemies that require the player to jump and dodge to avoid.
* Environmental enemies: Environmental enemies are enemies that are integrated into the game's level design. Examples of environmental enemies include falling boulders or collapsing platforms that the player must avoid. These types of enemies add an extra layer of challenge to the game and can create a more immersive experience for the player.
* Bosses: Bosses are powerful enemies that are designed to challenge the player and often require unique strategies to defeat. Bosses can be designed to have multiple stages, each with their own unique attacks and patterns. Designing bosses that require the player to use all their acquired abilities and experience can create an intense and rewarding experience for players.

And for a more complex challenge plan to implement enemies that can follow the player and adapt to their movements, making for dynamic and unpredictable gameplay. When implementing pathfinding enemies, it's important to balance the challenge with fairness. For example, enemies that are too aggressive or overpowered can make the game frustrating and unfun, while enemies that are too easy to avoid can make the game too easy. Designing enemies that require careful planning and skilful manoeuvring to defeat can make for engaging and satisfying gameplay.



## Limitations

### Time Constraints

With limited time available, it may be difficult to create a fully fleshed-out game with a polished design. Balancing the creation of an engaging gameplay experience with the constraints of limited development time can be a challenge. To overcome this limitation, setting realistic goals and prioritizing the most important features and design elements can help ensure that the game can be completed within the available time frame. Additionally, leveraging the Kaboom community and resources available online can help speed up the development process

### Programming language limitations

The Kaboom programming language may not have all the capabilities required to implement certain features or designs. This could limit the overall scope of the game and may require additional time and effort to find workarounds or alternative solutions. However, Kaboom is an easy-to-use and intuitive game development tool that allows students to create games quickly without prior experience in game development or programming. Moreover, the Kaboom community is very supportive and helpful, and students can take advantage of the many online resources available, including examples, documentation, and tutorials.

### Testing and feedback

Testing and getting feedback from other players is an essential aspect of game development, as it helps to identify and fix issues and improve the overall gameplay experience. However, finding sufficient time to test and refine the game and to get feedback from other players can be challenging.
