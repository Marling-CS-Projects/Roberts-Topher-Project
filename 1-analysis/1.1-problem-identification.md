The primary video game to really get a foothold in the industry and pioneer many generations to come would be Mario, by Nintendo, although it's not the first it has definitely set itself out to be a classic which many games have used for inspiration many years later.&#x20;

I personally also use the game and elements from its genre to inspire my game, however, platformer games have been on the decline as time passes, (_see Fig.2)._ Populatioty has shifted to other genres, especially in youths which make up the majority of players.

Although platformer games have seen a decline in recent years, the video game industry continues to grow overall. This trend can be attributed to the rising popularity of other game genres, such as first-person shooters, sports games, and battle royale games (Statista, 2021).

The graph illustrates the movement in popularity across various game genres and offers insights into the expansion of the video game market by genre. It becomes clear that although other genres like first-person shooters, sports games, and battle royale games have seen a rise in popularity recently, platformer games have seen a fall in recent years. Technology developments that have allowed game developers to produce more realistic and immersive gaming experiences that appeal to a broader audience could be one reason for this trend. Additionally, the social component of gaming has grown in significance, and many well-liked titles in these growing genres now include robust multiplayer features that let players connect and engage in competition with others around the world. The Statista infographic effectively illustrates the ever-changing landscape of the video game industry and emphasizes the need for adaptation to maintain relevance in this dynamic market.

It's important to note that despite platformers losing some appeals, many gamers still hold them in high regard, and new platformer games are still being created and launched. In reality, recent platformers like Hollow Knight and Celest have received both positive reviews from critics and positive financial results.

Innovative gaming genres could become the next big thing as the industry develops and new technology is created. Nonetheless, persistent contributions to the industry made by legendary titles like Mario will ensure that they are always remembered and enjoyed.
