# 1.1 Problem Identification

The Video game endustry has fully established themselves as a core part of entertainment industry and has shown its hear to stay __ The industy has and is forcasted to contine growth through out the years. _(see Fig .1)_

The priamry video game to really get a foot hold in the industy and pioneer many generations too come would be the Mario, by nintendo, alothogh its not the first it has definetly set its self out to be a classic wich many games use for inspiration many years later.&#x20;

I personaly also am using the game and elements from its genre to inspire my game, however platformer games have been on the decline as time passes, (_see Fig.2)._ Populatioty has shifted other genres epecialy in youths wich make up the majority of players.

The problam i am attempting to chalnge is to produce a platfomer video game the would bring back some relevance of the gernre.
