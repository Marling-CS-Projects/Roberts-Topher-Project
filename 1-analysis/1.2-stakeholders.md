## Customer Role

When determining the appropriate age range for video games, the consumer's perspective is equally crucial. In addition to making sure their games are fun and engaging, game makers need to make sure the games are appropriate for the age group they are targeting. Additionally, game designers should think about the possible effects their products may have on their players and make sure they are not encouraging any dangerous or undesirable behaviour.

Customers also contribute to the PEGI rating system because they ultimately decide whether to buy and play a game. The PEGI system enables customers to make educated decisions about which games are appropriate for themselves or their children by giving precise and succinct age ratings. This gives users the power to choose the games they play responsibly and supports the idea of a fun and secure gaming environment for all.

## Demographics

Demographics are an important consideration for game developers when creating a new game. In particular, age ratings are essential when designing games for different age groups. The Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system is widely used for the age classification of video games in Europe. The PEGI rating system provides clear and concise guidance on the suitability of games for different age groups.

## PEGI ratings

The PEGI rating system has several categories, including 3, 7, 12, 16, and 18. The categories are based on the content of the game, and the age of the player that the game is suitable. The 3 rating is suitable for players of all ages, while the 7 rating is suitable for players aged 7 years and older. The 12 rating is suitable for players aged 12 years and older, while the 16 rating is suitable for players aged 16 years and older. The 18 rating is suitable for players aged 18 years and older.

The suitable PEGI rating for a 2D platforming game targeted at all demographics would probably be 3. This is due to the fact that 2D platforming games frequently have straightforward gameplay principles that are simple to grasp and generally have age-appropriate material. A higher rating may be necessary, nevertheless, if the game contains any offensive or violent material.

Finally, when producing new games, game producers must take the age of their intended audience into account. In Europe, the PEGI grading system is extensively used to categorise video games according to their intended audience by age. It offers clear, succinct instructions on which games are appropriate for which age groups. The PEGI rating of 3 would be appropriate for a 2D platforming game intended for all audiences. A higher rating may be necessary, nevertheless, if the game contains any offensive or violent material.
