# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements are a set of instructions or specifications that outline what needs to be done in order to create a software application, website, or any other technology-related project.

These requirements describe the features, functionalities, and overall goals of the project. They provide a roadmap or a clear plan for the developers to follow during the development process.

| Software  | Hardware Required                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Package 1 | <ul><li>Proc</li><li>RAM</li><li>Disk Space</li></ul> |

References are recommended
