| 5 - Easy to Learn  | How easy is the game to pick up and play?                      |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

Effective

</div>

this is an important question to ensure that users clearly understand what to do and the goal is quick and easy to find.&#x20;

This ensureure that users belive that the game fits the age rating stated.

THis is key information as it help me adjust the difficulty of the game and level design to ensure that the game its easy at the start and the difficulty slowly increases
