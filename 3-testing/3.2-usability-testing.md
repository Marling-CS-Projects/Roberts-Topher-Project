## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know how to complete the levels?                        |
| 2 - Efficient      | Where the controls intuitive?                                  |
| 3 - Engaging       | Would you play the game again? How varied is the level design? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any major bugs you experienced while playing?        |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | How easy is the game to pick up and play?                      |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

**Effective**

Question 1

</div>

this is an important question to ensure that users clearly understand what to do and the goal is quick and easy to find.&#x20;

**Efficent**&#x20;

Question 1&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is a key part of the game and intuitive controls allow for the game to be exesible and without clear and easy controls the player exerience would be vastly diffrent, and for the worse as the player would be fightiing the controls

**Engaging**

This is a key part of testing alowing the developers to ensure the game is fun to play and that its repeatable.

&#x20;**Error Tolerant**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>results form servay in sheet form</p></figcaption></figure>

This is expretmily important question to ask as it provides feed back on bugs to they can be fixed

**Easy to Learn**

Question 1

THis is key information as it help me adjust the difficulty of the game and level design to ensure that the game its easy at the start and the difficulty slowly increases
